# Installation
If you don't have Go installed, download it from <a href="https://go.dev/dl/">here</a> or install it from your package manager. Then, run the command below:
```bash
go install github.com/HACKERALERT/Picocrypt/cli/v2/picocrypt@latest
```
You should now be able to run `picocrypt` in your terminal. If not, run `export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin` and try again.
